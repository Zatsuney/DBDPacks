# GitHub Page Image Gallery

This project is a simple one-page image gallery hosted on GitHub Pages. It allows users to view a collection of images in a visually appealing layout.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files and directories:

- **index.html**: The main HTML document that structures the webpage and includes links to the CSS and JavaScript files.
- **styles/**: A directory containing the CSS file for styling the webpage.
  - **main.css**: Contains styles for layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of the image gallery.
- **scripts/**: A directory containing the JavaScript file for functionality.
  - **app.js**: Handles loading images, creating a responsive layout, and any interactive features.
- **images/**: A directory intended to hold the image files that will be displayed in the gallery. Place your image files here.
