The images directory is intended to hold your image files. Since you need to add images here, you can place your image files in this directory. However, as I cannot create actual image files, I will provide a placeholder for the image files you can use.

Here is the content for the file path `/githubpage-image-gallery/githubpage-image-gallery/images/(your-image-files-here)`:

# This directory is intended to hold your image files for the gallery. 
# Please add your image files here, such as:
# - image1.jpg
# - image2.png
# - image3.gif
# etc.
